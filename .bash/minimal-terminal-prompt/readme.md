## Bash Installation

Clone and cd into the repo, then copy the desired PS1 .sh file contents into your  `~/.bashrc`.
Then just reload your bash profile (either restart your cmd, or run the  source command)

```
git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/minimal-terminal-prompt.git

cd minimal-terminal-prompt

cat minimal-terminal-prompt.sh  >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc
```

_**Note, for Mac OS X:** Because by default OS X starts a login session first,
the file `~/.bash_profile` can be used in place of  `~/.bashrc`. Read more about this on this
[GNU Documentation Article](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html)._


**References and Further Reading:** All the information you could ever want to know about customising your bash PS1 prompt
can be found on this detailed Linux Documentation and how-to guide, by Giles Orr:
