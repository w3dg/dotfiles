### Things included out of the repo -

  I've tried to include VSCode settings as well, although that may keep changing. You can find them in the [Setup]("./Setup.md").

  VSCode has a settings sync feature which helps you manage your settings across your instances automatically.

  List of fonts I use -

  - Anonymous Pro
